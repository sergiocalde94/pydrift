to pydrift 0.2.5\nHow do we measure the degradation of a machine learning process? Why does the performance of our predictive models decrease? Maybe it is that a data source has changed (one or more variables) or maybe what changes is the relationship of these variables with the target we want to predict. pydrift tries to facilitate this task to the data scientist, performing this kind of checks and somehow measuring that degradation.\nInstall pydrift\nWith pip:\npip install pydrift\nWith conda:\nconda install -c conda-forge pydrift\nWith poetry\npoetry add pydrift\nStructure\nThis is intended to be user-friendly. pydrift is divided into DataDriftChecker and ModelDriftChecker:\n\nDataDriftChecker: searches for drift in the variables, check if their distributions have changed\nModelDriftChecker: searches for drift in the relationship of the variables with the target, checks that the model behaves the same way for both data sets\n\nBoth can use a discriminative model (defined by parent class DriftChecker), where the target would be binary in belonging to one of the two sets, 1 if it is the left one and 0 on the contrary. If the model is not able to differentiate given the two sets, there is no difference!\n\nIt also exists InterpretableDrift and DriftCheckerEstimator:\n\nInterpretableDrift: manages all of the stuff related to interpretability of drifting. It can show us the features distribution or the most important features when we are training a discriminative model or our predictive one\nDriftCheckerEstimator: allows pydrift to be used as a sklearn estimator, it works lonely or in a pipeline, like any sklearn estimator\n\nUsage\nYou can take a look to the notebooks folder where you can find one example for generic DriftChecker, one for DataDriftChecker and other one for ModelDriftChecker. \nCorrect Notebooks Render\nBecause pydrift uses plotly and GitHub performs a static render of the notebooks figures do not show correctly. For a rich view of the notebook, you can visit  nbviewer and paste the link to the notebook you want to show, for example if you want to render 1-Titanic-Drift-Demo.ipynb you have to paste https://github.com/sergiocalde94/pydrift/blob/master/notebooks/1-Titanic-Drift-Demo.ipynb into nbviewer.  \nMore Info\nFor more info check the docs available here\nMore demos and code improvements will coming, if you want to contribute you can contact me (sergiocalde94@gmail.com), in the future I will upload a file to explain how this would work.\n"},"docs/data_drift/data_drift.html":{"url":"docs/data_drift/data_drift.html","title":"Data Drift","keywords":"","body":"Data Drift\n¿What is the meaning of data drift in pydrift?\nDefinition\nData drifting is all related to your features drift, it checks when the features in a dataset are not aligned with other dataset ones.\nThe most common use case is when you train a model with a dataset, let's call it df_train and you want to apply your model to other dataset, for example df_test.\nIf the data you used for training your model is different that the data when you apply the model, then your model performance will be poor.\nSo data drift part of pydrift helps you to detect this changes that every feature has and understanding why your model is not working well.\n\nYour model takes into account patterns and features distributions from the training data features.\nFor example if you train a model with a feature that ranges between 0 and 10 and then in your test data has a different distribution, for example 100 to 1000, then your model won't work as expected.\nTypes of data drift\n\nNumerical features drift: pydrift.DataDriftChecker.check_numerical_columns\nCategorical features drift: pydrift.DataDriftChecker.check_categorical_columns\nInteraction between features drift (discriminative model): pydrift.DataDriftChecker.ml_model_can_discriminate\n\nNumerical columns drift\nFor checking drift in numerical columns, pydrift takes, one by one, all of the numerical features and apply a Kolmogorov-Smirnov Test for checking if the distributions are unbiased.\nThis is a statistical method that checks for this differences and pydrift uses stats.ks_2samp from the famous scipy python library to easily check it.\nCategorical columns drift\nFor checking drift in categorical columns, pydrift takes, one by one, all of the categorical features and apply a chi Test for checking if the distributions are unbiased.\nThis is a statistical method that checks for this differences and pydrift uses stats.chisquare from the famous scipy python library to easily check it.\nInteraction between features drift (discriminative model)\nFor a more general drift checking, pydrift trains a machine learning model (catboost by default, but you can use any model from sklearn API) creating a new target that indicates if a register comes from training distibution or from the testing one.\nIf the model can discriminate and obtains a good metric (AUC in this case) that means that your date is easily distinguishable, so you have a drift in your data.\nIf on the contrary the model is not able to differentiate between train and test data it means that you do not have any drift problem and that the data is not biased, so you will be able to apply your model without problems (waiting for the model drift checker step, that relies in your features relation with the correct target feature).\n"},"docs/model_drift/model_drift.html":{"url":"docs/model_drift/model_drift.html","title":"Model Drift","keywords":"","body":"Model Drift\n¿What is the meaning of model drift in

some features with drift but they are not important for the model, so you can just drop them and everything will be rigth (you can keep them because they are not so important, but you will have a cleaner version of your machine learning workflow if you avoid to use them).\n\nWeights\nWeight are the useful for retrain your model passing this weights to it. Your new model will be much more confident on the data that is not drift than on the data that it is, getting better performance.\nIf this visualization is too sparse it is not useful to retrain a model with this weights, but sometimes this approach is quite good.\n\nPartial Dependence Comparison\nThis visualization tells you the mean prediction of each bin of your features values. It will draw a scatter plot with a trend line if the feature you are viewing is a numerical feature and a bar plot if it is a categorical feature.\nThe trends in predictions given the feature value has to follow the same patterns, if not, like the example bellow there is a drift in your model predictions.\n\nDrift By Sorted Bins\nData contained in both datasets are concatenated and sorted by the feature you want. It divides in custom number of bins, ten by default, and count how much data is present from what dataset.\nIf your data has no drift all of the bins has to be almost equal.\n\n"},"docs/demos/general_drift.html":{"url":"docs/demos/general_drift.html","title":"General Drift","keywords":"","body":"General Drift Demo\nYou can check this demo to understand how you can apply general drift checker to your problem.\nThis is developed with famous Titanic Dataset from kaggle.\n"},"docs/demos/data_drift.html":{"url":"docs/demos/data_drift.html","title":"Data Drift","keywords":"","body":"Data Drift Demo\nYou can check this demo to understand how you can apply data drift checker to your problem.\nThis is developed with famous Titanic Dataset from kaggle.\n"},"docs/demos/model_drift.html":{"url":"docs/demos/model_drift.html","title":"Model Drift","keywords":"","body":"Model Drift Demo\nYou can check this demo to understand how you can apply model drift checker to your problem.\nThis is developed with famous Titanic Dataset from kaggle.\n"},"docs/demos/drift_checker_estimator.html":{"url":"docs/demos/drift_checker_estimator.html","title":"Drift Checker Estimator","keywords":"","body":"Drift Checker Estimator Demo\nYou can check this demo to understand how you can apply drift checker estimator to your problem.\nThis is developed with famous Titanic Dataset from kaggle.\n"}}}
